        <h1>Welcome to the Video Timing Calculator</h1>
        <p>
          This tool is designed to help you calculate and configure various
          parameters for video timing and MIPI configurations. Explore the
          following pages to get started:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> Provide quick, accurate calculations for
          video timing (active area, blanking intervals, pixel clock) and MIPI
          D-PHY parameters based on display presets or custom inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Target audience:</strong> FPGA/SoC designers, display
          interface engineers, firmware developers, applications engineers, and
          validation/test teams working with MIPI DSI/CSI and general video
          pipelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Typical use cases:</strong> sizing blanking for timing
          closure, estimating lane rates and bandwidth, validating
          sensor/display configurations, and sharing configurations across
          teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Who should use this:</strong> Teams building camera/display
          interfaces, prototyping embedded vision systems, or validating
          board-level video paths on Lattice devices.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What it covers:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Video timing fundamentals: total/active pixels, horizontal/vertical
            blanking, frame rate, pixel clock.
          </li>
          <li>
            MIPI D-PHY sizing: lane count, lane rate, payload efficiency,
            byte/bit clocks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Color formats and bit depths: RGB and YCbCr options with derived
            bits-per-pixel.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open <a href="video_timing.html">Video Timing</a> and select a
            preset resolution or enter custom values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust horizontal/vertical blanking as needed; derived fields update
            automatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            Review outputs (pixel clock, totals) and proceed to
            <a href="dphy.html">Soft D-PHY</a> to size lane rate and lanes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use <a href="config.html">MIPI Configuration</a> to finalize format
            and interface details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optionally export inputs/outputs as JSON for documentation and
            reviews.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Assumptions & limitations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Calculations assume synchronous pixel domain and typical D-PHY
            efficiency; verify exact requirements with panel/sensor datasheets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Results provide engineering estimates; hardware validation is
            recommended.
          </li>
